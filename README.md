Moongazing gRPC Project
Overview

The Moongazing project exemplifies the implementation of a gRPC service utilizing the robust and versatile .NET 8 framework. gRPC, a high-performance, modern framework, is designed for efficient inter-service communication in varied environments, offering comprehensive support for features like load balancing, tracing, health checks, and authentication.
Prerequisites

.NET 8 SDK: Essential for development.

Getting Started
Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/Moongazing/Moongazing-gRPC.git

Project Structure

Protos: This directory holds the Protocol Buffer (.proto) files, which define the structure of the gRPC service and its messages.
Server: Contains the server-side implementation of the gRPC service.
Client: Houses the client-side code to interact with the gRPC service.

Setting Up the Server

Navigate: Go to the Server directory.
Build: Compile the project.
Run: Launch the server.

Setting Up the Client

Navigate: Move to the Client directory.
Build: Compile the client project.
Run: Execute the client to communicate with the server.

Features

Efficient gRPC communication using .NET 8.
Enhanced security through SSL/TLS encryption.
Token-based authentication for secured access to gRPC endpoints.
Seamless integration of gRPC with ASP.NET Core for robust web service development.
